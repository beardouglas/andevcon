# Android sample code for Facebook classes at AnDevCon Boston

This app is a simple "Resources Browser" for Facebook information. It is the standard master-detail Android app template pre-filled with content about Facebook's developer resources. The purpose of this sample is to go over how you can add Facebook Login and social features to an existing Android app.

Over the course of the demo, we will add Facebook Login to the app; make an API call for information about the currently logged-in user; share back to Facebook using a Feed Dialog; send Requests using a Requests Dialog; read Open Graph data and publish an Open Graph story.
